Tic tac toe is a simple board game for 2 players:  X and O. who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.<br />
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner

In my project I did 2 different things:
## Tic Tac Toe Artificial intelligence (MinMax) VS Machine learning:
MinMax is an optimal algorithm for tic tac toe game, so I wanted to check how good ML algorithms are and at which point they are started to show good results.<br />
#### Challenges:
* How to create my own data and make my ML algorithms "learn".
* Implementation of the board and compitable with AI algorithms.
* Implement the AI (MinMax).<br />

I implemented random walk generator, that way I can train my model (Random walk VS. MinMax).

I checked Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN against MinMax and then just for fun I tried to see what results i'll get if i'll run ML vs. ML.<br />

<br />
So in this example we can see the improvements in the result when the data is too small against big data.

For more info and results please check my code and my presentation attached.
## Tic Tac Toe prediction:
simple uses of Machine learning algorithms to check the accuracy of ML algorithms to predict the winner of finished tic-tac-toe game boards.
dataset from UCI called "Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame dataset"! <br />
Some algorithms shows better results and some worse, but the best ones was SVM and Logistic Regression, although they arent prefect.
I tried to check the misclassification to see why they failed and found out we have so "problem" in the dataset with tie games.
